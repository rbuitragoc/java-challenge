About Pushing your Material
===========================

## Folder Structure

The repository contains only the markdown files with instructions - which you shouldn't modify. Also, it contains three folders, with very specific roles:

- `src`: make sure you add all of your working code under this source, feel free to add subfolders as you consider necessary.
- `essay`:  use this to host your text-based responses. You can add any (mostly recognizable) type of text file here with the answers.
- `design`: your designs in UML or other type of diagrams should be added here.

## Access Permissions

The repository java-challenge has `read-only` access for you, which means that you will have to fork it. Make sure you add the remote repo as appropriate.
You can work on a separate branch in your local environment, for example, "`my-poem-creator`".  Finally, when you're ready to submit your code, create a pull request against master branch.
